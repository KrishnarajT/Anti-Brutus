This project was made as a part of the assignments for Full Stack Development Course at MIT WPU.
We are grateful to our teachers, and our parents for encouraging us to keep trying new stuff, without any restrictions.
None of this would be possible without their help.

We are also grateful to our friends, for their inputs on the looks and features of the website, and for constantly encourating us to keep going.
