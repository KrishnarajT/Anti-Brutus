          Vaults are a way to organize your passwords. You can create as many
          vaults as you want, and store passwords in each vault. This way, you
          can organize your passwords based on their use.
          <br />
          <br />
          You can save various kinds of sensitive data in your vaults, like your
          credit card details, your bank account details, your Aadhar Card Info,
          etc. There are pre built templates for all of these to choose from.
